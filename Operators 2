#Identity Operator
a=[15,25]
b=[15,25]
c=a

print(a==b) #it returns true because a is equals to b

#is not operator returns true if both variable are not the same object

print(a is not c) #it returns false as a is the same object as c

print(b is not c)# it returns true because b is the not the same object as c

print(a!=b)#it returns false as a is equals to b



#Membership  Operator

#These operators are used to test if a sequence is present or not in an object
a=[10,20,30,40]

print(20 in a)
print(20 not in a)
#in operator -----it returns true it sequence is present in an object
#not in operator -----it returns true it sequence is not present in an object





#Bitwise operator
#They are used to compare binary numbers
#&=> AND => if both bits are 1 , it sets each bits to 1

#| => OR => if one of the two bits is 1, it sets each bit to 1, otherwise 0
#^ => XOR => if only one of the bits is 1 ,it sets each bit to 1
# ~ => Inverts all the bits,or in other words complements operator,or it returns it complement to another[A=(-A+1)]



#<< => zero fill left shift => the binary number is appended with o,s at the end
#>> => Right shift => in simple terms the right side of the bits is removed
